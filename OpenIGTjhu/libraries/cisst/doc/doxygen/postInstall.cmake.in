# install process:  Finally succeded at having "make install" to install
# files generated by Doxygen and LaTeX2Html without having to type
# "make install_html".  This closes the ticket #40.

# Revision 1.1  2004/09/03 20:03:50  anton
# CMake for documentation: Since version 2.0 of CMake, we should be able to
# add a CMake script to install multiple files.  Until now, we had to use
# "make install; make install_html" to install everything.  Unfortunately,
# this new feature of CMake seems buggy.  I am commiting these changes in
# order to keep track of my attempts and hopefully the CMake team will
# reply to my bug/feature requests.  See ticket #40.
