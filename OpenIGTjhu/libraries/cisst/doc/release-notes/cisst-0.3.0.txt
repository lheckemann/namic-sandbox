cisst package 0.3.0 
Release date: 2006-01-31 (January 31, 2006)

- cisstCommon:

  * Added cmnThrow function.  cmnThrow is to be used to throw every
    exception in the cisst package.  This function allows to log the
    message if any, define a break point while debugging (avoid to
    unroll the stack), or use CMN_ASSERT (i.e. assert) instead of an
    exception.

  * Improved CMN_ASSERT.  CMN_ASSERT is to be used instead of
    assert().  It allows to log and can be configured to throw an
    exception instead instead of abort().  By default, when Python
    wrappers are build, CMN_ASSERT throws an exception which allows to
    recover from an error.

  * All "assert"s and "throw"s have been replaced in the cisst
    package.

  * Added some constants: cmnPI, cmnPI_2, cmnPI_4
  

- cisstVector:

  * Added methods for Ceil, Floor, MinAndMax on all containers.

  * Add vector quicksheet document to list most features of
    cisstVector.

  * All transformations have been updated to provide three different
    types of conversions (see constructors and methods From, FromRaw
    and FromNormalized).  These method allows to use an input which
    can be normalized or not.

  * Added AlmostEquivalent for all transformations.  These methods
    test for equivalence as opposed to the elementwise equality for
    AlmostEqual and Equal (and ==) which are also available.

  * vctDynamicMatrix::SetSize doesn't change the storage order by
    default anymore.

  * Added MatrixSizeType (vector of two values) to pass the size back
    and forth between methods.


- cisstNumerical:

  * Introduced a new framework for all Fortran wrappers and other
    functions which require a workspace.  The new approach is based on
    a "data" object which facilitate the memory allocation and global
    functions.  For example, nmrSVDSolver is now replaced by the
    classes nmrSVDDynamicData and nmrSVDFixedSizeData with the
    overloaded global function nmrSVD.

    So far, SVD, PInverse, LU, IsOrthonormal and Inverse have been
    ported.  The following wrappers are not yet ported: FminSolver,
    FnJacobianSolver, FnSolver, HFTISolver, LDPSolver, LSEISolver,
    LSISolver, LSNonLinJacobianSolver, LSNonLinSolver, LSSolver,
    NNLSSolver, SVDRSSolver.  Release 0.3.1 should include a new
    version of these.

  * Added support for cisstNetlib.  The current package of netlib
    routines (called cnetlib) is not thread safe.  We now provide a
    new binary distribution based on the Fortran 90 LAPACK3E called
    cisstNetlib.  Most wrappers in cisstNumerical have been updated to
    support both netlib binary distributions.  Some multithreaded
    tests are also available. See www.cisst.org/cnetlib to download
    these distributions.

  * Added Inverse function for fixed size matrices.  See
    nmrGaussJordanInverseNxN for N = 2, 3 or 4.

  * Added numerical quickstart document.


- cisstInteractive:

  * Initial release include:
    - wxPython interactive shell
    - ireFramework to start the shell from C
    - example illustrating cisstInteractive
    - cisstInteractive quickstart document 


- New deprecated classes and functions:

  - nmrSVDSolver replaced by nmrSVD
  - nmrLUSolver replaced by nmrLU
  - nmrPInverseSolver replaced by nmrPInverse
