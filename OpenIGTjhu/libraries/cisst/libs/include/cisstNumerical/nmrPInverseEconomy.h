  Algorithm P-Inverse: Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse Calculates the
  Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of the M by N matrix A, and stores the
  result in PInverse.  The singular values of A are returned in S.
  The left singular vectors are returned in U, and the right singular
  vectors are returned in V.

  \f$ A^{+} = V * \Sigma^{+} * U^{T} \f$

  where \f$ \Sigma^{+} \f$ is a \f$ N \times M \f$ matrix which is
  zero except for its min(m,n) diagonal elements, U is a \f$ M \times
  M \f$ orthogonal matrix, and V is a \f$ N \times N \f$ orthogonal
  matrix.  The diagonal elements of \f$ \Sigma^{+} \f$ are the
  reciprocal ofc non-zero singular values of A; they are real and
  non-negative, andc are returned in descending order.  The first \f$
  \mbox{min}(m,n) \f$ columns of U and V are the left and right
  singular vectors of A.

  \note This routine returns \f$ V^{T} \f$, not \f$ V \f$.
  \note *On exit*, the content of *A is altered.*

  There are three ways to call this method to compute the pseudo-inverse of
  the matrix A.
  METHOD 1: User provides matrices A and A^{+}
     1) The User allocates memory for these matrices and
     vector.
     vctDynamicMatrix<double> A(5, 4);
     vctDynamicMatrix<double> PInverse(4, 5);
     ...
     2) The user calls the SVD routine
     nmrPInverseEconomy(A, PInverse);
     The PInverse method verifies that the size of the data objects matches
     the input, and allocates workspace memory, which is deallocated when
     the function ends.
     The PInverse function alters the contents of matrix A.
     For fixed size the function call is templated by size and row/column major, e.g.
     nmrPInverseEconomy<4, 3, VCT_COL_MAJOR>(A, PInverse);

  METHOD 2: Using a preallocated data object
     1) The user creates the input matrix
     vctDynamicMatrix<double> input(rows, cols , VCT_ROW_MAJOR);
     2) The user allocats a data object which could be of
     type nmrPInverseEconomyDynamicData and nmrPInverseEconomyDynamicDataRef
     corresponding to fixed size, dynamic matrix or dynamic matrix reference.
     nmrPInverseEconomyDynamicData data(input);
     3) Call the nmrPInverseEconomy function
     nmrPInverseEconomy(input, data);
     The contents of input matrix is modified by this routine.
     The matrices U, Vt and vector S are available through the following methods
     std::cout << data.U() << data.S() << data.Vt() << std::endl;
     The pseudo-inverse is available through data.PInverse()

  METHOD 3: User provides matrix PInverse
     with workspace required by pseudo-inverse routine of LAPACK.
     1) User creates matrices and vector
     vctDynamicMatrix<double> A(5, 4);
     vctDynamicMatrix<double> PInverse(4, 5);
     2) User also needs to allocate memory for workspace. This method is particularly
     useful when the user is using more than one numerical methods from the library
     and is willing to share the workspace between them. In such as case, the user
     can allocate the a memory greater than the maximum required by different methods.
     To aid the user determine the minimum workspace required (and not spend time digging
     LAPACK documentation) the library provides helper function
     nmrPInverseEconomyDynamicData::WorkspaceSize(input)
     vctDynamicVector<double> Work(nmrPInverseEconomyDynamicData::WorkspaceSize(A));
     3) Call the SVD function
     nmrPInverseEconomy(A, PInverse, Work);

     \note The PInverse functions make use of LAPACK routines.  To activate this
     code, set the CISST_HAS_CNETLIB flag to ON during the configuration
     with CMake.
     \note The general rule for numerical functions which depend on LAPACK is that 
     column-major matrices should be used everywhere, and that all
     matrices should be compact.
     \note For the specific case of PInverse, a valid result is also obtained if
     all the matrices are stored in row-major order.  This is an exeption to
     the general rule.  However, mixed-order is not tolerated.
