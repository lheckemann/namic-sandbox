Neuroscientists hypothesize that many neurological diseases are associated with neuroanatomical abnormalities.  Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) allows us to probe and investigate anatomical differences in nerve fiber tracts. Current DTI clinical studies use voxel-based analysis.  Tractography is a better way to characterize fiber tracts.  Probabilistic tractography methods are even better because they provide a measure of uncertainty.  This project will enable novel studies fiber tract abnormalities by creating an interactive system for probabilistic tractography and an open-source implementation of the tractography algorithm. We will then use the system to study white matter structure and its changes in schizophrenia.
