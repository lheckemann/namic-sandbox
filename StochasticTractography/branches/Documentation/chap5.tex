\chapter{Group Study of Frontal Lobe Fibers in Schizophrenia}
This section presents the outline of an ongoing group study of the frontal lobe fiber differences in Schizophrenia using the stochastic tractography system.  This group study is an extension of the single subject analysis of frontal lobe fibers presented in the previous section.  The study also provides an opportunity to compare findings using stochastic tractography with those previously obtained from streamlining tractography on identical data sets.

\section{Schizophrenia}
Schizophrenia is neurological disorder whose characteristic symptoms include hallucinations and disorganized thinking.  Scientists have suggested that the pathology of schizophrenia may involve anatomical abnormalities including abnormal white matter architecture.  Clinical DTI studies have demonstrated differences in diffusion anisotropy within fiber tracts in Schizophrenia patients compared with healthy patients \cite{kubickiBiologPsych03},\cite{kubickiNI05}.

White matter architecture abnormalities related to schizophrenia may include a reduction in the integrity or amount of the myelin, increased disorganization of fibers which constitute certain fiber bundles, or a reduction in the number of fibers comprising a fiber bundle. Myelin, the fatty insulator which surrounds the axons, is believed to be a major barrier to water diffusion.  Degradation of the myelin will permit increased diffusion perpendicular to the orientation of the fibers which can be observed as reduced anisotropy in DTI data.  Also the orientation of axon fibers which comprise a fiber bundle may be less directionally coherent in Schizophrenia.  Since many fibers pass through a single voxel and the resultant diffusion distribution is an average of diffusion of all water molecules that voxel, a voxel containing fibers which are less coherent may have reduced anisotropy.  The fibers bundles may also be less dense in Schizophrenia.  A reduction in axon density would also result in reduced anisotropy water molecules are more free to diffuse perpendicularly to the tracts.  All of these structural deficiencies result in poorer conduction of action potentials between different regions of the brain leading to reduced functional connectivity.

\end{figure}
The fibers that connect the thalamus and the frontal lobe are believed to be involved in memory formation.  These fibers are depicted in figure \ref{fig:frontallobefibers}.  Since Schizophrenia patients have difficulty forming and organizing memory, deficiencies in these fibers may explain these symptoms.  Additionally these fibers are interesting from a tractography standpoint because there are many other fibers which cross this set of fibers on their way to the frontal cortex.  In these regions of crossing, the diffusion is averaged with the crossing fiber resulting in a diffusion profile with reduced anisotropy.  This is precisely the situation for which stochastic tractography can be useful since streamlining methods would terminate in regions of low anisotropy possibly never reaching the frontal cortex.  In this study, we analyze these fibers in schizophrenia and control groups to determine whether schizophrenia patients exhibit lower tract-averaged fractional anisotropy than the control group.  Additionally, we will compare results obtained using stochastic tractography with previous streamline tractography results.

\section{Method}
We will first obtain DWI data sets for as many schizophrenia and control subjects as possible.  Each DWI data set will consist of at least 6 gradient weighted images and 1 baseline image as this is the minimum required for the stochastic tractography system.  Additionally we will create a white matter map for each subject either by a segmentation of an additional anatomical image obtained during the DWI aquisition or through the segmentation of the B0 image.  Labelmaps for the right and left internal capsules for each subject is created through expert manual segmentation.  A additional ROI is placed in the frontal lobe to isolate fibers which originate in the internal capsules and proceed towards the frontal lobe.

The stochastic tractography system is then used to generate tract length and tract-averaged FA statistics for tracts which originate in the right internal capsule and pass through the frontal lobe ROI.  The system will be run again for tracts which originate in the left internal capsule and pass through frontal lobe ROI.  These analysis are performed for all subjects.  Tracts will be sampled until the mean of the length and tract-averaged FA distributions show a degree of stability with respect to the number of samples.

Assuming that the mean tract-averaged FA is normally distributed , a t-test is then used to determine whether the mean of the mean tract-averaged FA differs significantly between schizophrenia subjects and normal subjects.  The same is performed for the distribution of tract lengths.

These results will also be compared streamline tractography results which found significant differences in the mean of the mean tract-averaged FA between schizophrenia and control groups\footnote{Streamline tractography results courtesy Gudrun Rosenberger}.

%Figure \ref{fig:facomp} graphs the distribution of tract-averaged FA for each patient.  A t-test comparing the mean tract-averaged FA of the schizophrenia group with the control group did not reveal any statistically significant differences.  This was found under both streamlining tractography as well as stochastic tractography.
