Create a simplified filter that takes in reference and base images and outputs random paths
  Derive from either light object or process object
  
Create a filter that takes as input reference images and outputs tensors model and residual map.

Create a filter that takes as input ref images and outputs parameters of constrained model and residual map

Create a filter that takes as input parameters of constrained model and residual map and generates paths

Create a filter that takes as input paths and outputs a connectivity map.

Later change the filter so that it uses a vector image internally.
Then allow an outside class to put the images together into a vector image

Change the tensor estimation class to output the estimated parameters of the tensor model in a 7 element vector.  The 6 element tensor itself is not sufficient to estimate the original intensity of the voxel.  The true intensity may be important because the noise distribution is dependent on the intensity of the voxel.
An adaptor can be created to translate between the vector parameter representation and the tensor representation.
Want to be able to calculate each voxel on demand.  Make sure there is a way to calculate the QR decomposition once and use it until the gradients are changed.

Most of the time taken is due to memory ops.

Program an itk program to easily read entries in a tensor file, and DWI file
