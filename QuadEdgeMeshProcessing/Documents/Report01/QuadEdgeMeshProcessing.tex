\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes a set of processing methods for manipulating
topologically correct meshes in the contest of Brain cortical studies. 

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.
This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must
facilitate \textbf{reproducibility} of the reported results.

\section{Introduction}

Topologically correct meshes are important\ldots

\section{Processing Needs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Extract surfaces as interface between two labels in a volumetric image
\item Map surfaces to spheres
\item Interpolate scalar functions from point data in the surface
\item Perform rigid registration based on scalar functions on the surface
\end{itemize}
