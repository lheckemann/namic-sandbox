The C++ files in this directory do not compile without other libraries for the I/O. 
They may or may not be helpful for writing the Analyze object reader for ITK but
are included for reference.

The file Object_Map_Format.doc was given to me by Denny Hanson of the Mayo Clinic
and gives the full description of the Analyze object file format.
