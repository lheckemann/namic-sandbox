Synopsis:
  ./convertAnalyzeToVTKImage inputImageFilename.img outputImageFilename.vti

This program uses ITK to read in an Analyze 7.5 image.  It then converts this to 
a VTK image and writes it to the user-specified .vti file using a 
vtkXMLImageDataWriter.

NOTE: This does NOT write vtkPolyData.  Therefore, attempting to surface render
the output .vti image will not work.
