\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes how to spammify sprockets.  It is a useful
example of a Insight HOWTO document.  It is not dependent on any
particular sprocket implementation, and includes a Insight-based
implementation in the \module{sprunkit} module.
\end{abstract}

\tableofcontents

Spammifying sprockets from Insight is both fun and entertaining.
Applying the techniques described here, you can also fill your hard
disk quite effectively.

\section{What is Sprocket Spammification?}

You have to ask?  It's the only thing to do to your sprockets!


\section{Why Use Insight?}

Insight is an excellent language from which to spammify your sprockets
since you can do it on any platform.

For example, here is some Insight code that illustrates our point

\small
\begin{verbatim}
typedef itk::Image< unsigned char, 3 > ImageType;

ImageType::Pointer image = ImageType::New();
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize


\section{Software Requirements}

You need to have the following software installed:

% The {itemize} environment uses a bullet for each \item.  If you want the 
% \item's numbered, use the {enumerate} environment instead.
\begin{itemize}
  \item  Insight 1.9.
  \item  Some sprocket definition files.
  \item  At least one sprocket system implementation.
\end{itemize}

Note that the \module{sprunkit} is provided with this package and
implements ActiveSprockets in Insight.


% The preceding sections will have been written in a gentler,
% introductory style.  You may also wish to include a reference
% section, documenting all the functions/exceptions/constants.
% Often, these will be placed in separate files and input like this:



\appendix

\section{This is an Appendix}

To create an appendix in a Insight HOWTO document, use markup like
this:

\begin{verbatim}
\appendix

\section{This is an Appendix}

To create an appendix in a Insight HOWTO document, ....


\section{This is another}

Just add another \section{}, but don't say \appendix again.
\end{verbatim}


\end{document}
