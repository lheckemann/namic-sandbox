/** PivotCalibration
 *
 *  This class encapsulates the pivot calibration algorithm and tracking
 *         data acquisition for performing tool tip calibration.
 *
 *  This class enables you to perform pivot calibration (tool tip calibration).
 *  The class is responsible for acquisition of tracking data and computation of
 *  the pivot calibration. You set the tracker of the specific tool and number
 *  of required transformations using the RequestInitialize() method. The class
 *  expects the tracker to be in Active tracking state and will generate an error if
 *  this is not the case. Once initialized the RequestComputeCalibration()
 *  method will start data acquisition and perform calibration. If data
 *  acquisition fails multiple times (e.g. line of sight is blocked for optical
 *  tracker) the calibration will fail and the appropriate event is generated.
