The two current classes in the development are (more detailes are available 
in the source files):

1) BinaryMaskTo3DAdaptiveMeshFilter
  Creates adaptive tetrahedralization of the input binary mask using the
  refinement algorithm described by Neil Molino (Standford University, 2004). 

  WARNING: predicates.c is copyrighted by Jonathan Shewchuk, the source code
  is available here: http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html
  This code is not likely to be a part of ITK. Before the code is released, I
  have to implement something way simpler to break the dependency.

  WARNING: the current version of the driver test makes use of VTK
  UnstructuredGridWriter. The second class developed within this project
  should eliminate this dependency, but this is not the highest priority right
  now. 

2) VTKUnstructuredGridMeshWriter
  Takes the ITK Mesh as input, and saves it in the VTK format. This class is
  not really something finished, but rather quick to have something to save
  the resulting VTK mesh in a file without having the dependency on VTK.

3) VolumeBoundaryCompressionMeshFilter
  Takes the mesh topology and aligns it with the boundary defined by the
  binary image
