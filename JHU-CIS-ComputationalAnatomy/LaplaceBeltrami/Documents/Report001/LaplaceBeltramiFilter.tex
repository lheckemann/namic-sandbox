\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes a contribution to the Insight Toolkit intended to
support the process of ... .  The methods included here are
restricted to Meshes with a Spherical geometry and topology, and with scalar
values associated to their nodes.

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.
This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must
facilitate \textbf{reproducibility} of the reported results.
