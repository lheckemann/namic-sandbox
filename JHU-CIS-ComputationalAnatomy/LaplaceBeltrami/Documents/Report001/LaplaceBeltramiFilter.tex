\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes a contribution to the Insight Toolkit intended to
support the process of statistical analysis in Computational Anatomy.
The methods included here are
restricted to closed, triagulated surfaces (represented by a QuadEdgeMesh) 
with a Spherical geometry and
topology.  The filter assigns basis function values as Point Data on each 
vertex of the Mesh.

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.
This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must
facilitate \textbf{reproducibility} of the reported results.

\section{Introduction}

In the field of Computational Anatomy the shape of biological structures are
compared mathematically between subjects.  The difference or similarity in shape
between subject structures is quantified and correlations between shape and
disease can be produced and examined for statistical significance.

Previous efforts have concentrated on using a single measurement, called metric
distance, to quantify difference in shape.  Statistical comparisons on metric
distance provide useful results, but information is lost in the
reduction of data down to one dimension.

It is desirable to reduce the dimensionality of statistical comparisons
between subjects, but maintain information that might be valuable in finding
correlations between shape and pathology.  A surface mesh can be represented in a way that its N most significant surface harmonics can be compared with other
subjects.

The purpose of this filter is to use the Laplace-Beltrami operator to determine
surface harmonics in terms of PointData at each vertex.  In the same way that
a sound signal can be approximately characterized by a combination of its most
significant frequency components, so can a surface be expressed as a combination
of its surface harmonics.  This filter determines the requested N most
significant harmonics.


\section{Overview}

The filter described in this report operates on \doxygen{QuadEdgeMesh}
data, and provides
the requested basis function as PointData in a copy of the Input Mesh.

\subsection{Algorithm}

The basic algorithm implemented in this filter involves visiting all the
faces of the triangulated Mesh, determining the face's area and the areas of
the associated vertices, then computes the laplacian operator as a sparse
matrix over the vertices.
