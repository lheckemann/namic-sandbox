# If this CURLConfig.cmake is in an install tree
# CURL_CONFIGURATION_TYPES will be empty and CURL_BUILD_TYPE
# will be set to the value of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE used to build
# CURL. If CURLConfig.cmake is in a build tree

# have values matching CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
# for that build tree (only one will ever be set).
