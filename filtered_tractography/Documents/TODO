For smallest spacing, set the \sigma_{i} = 0.5, and compute the remaining sigma's as follows:
   the spacing is (1.2,1.2,3) then, \sigma_x = \sigma_y = 0.5
   and \sigma_z = (3 x 0.5)/1.2

1. Integrate the signal normalization part into the tractography module (no one will use it otherwise).

2. Have a field where the user can specify the label number and the number of times to seed in that label.
   (If seeding 1 time, use deterministic seeding, or else randomly generate seeds as we do in the maltab case).

3. In the advanced tab, the user should be able to change Qm, Ql and Rs.

4. For the 2T, a field where the user can check "branch" and specify the angle of separation.  One level of branching.

5. Store the state and covariance at each point along the tract. (This could be use to compute FA, Trace etc) and
   return them to Slicer space for future access.
