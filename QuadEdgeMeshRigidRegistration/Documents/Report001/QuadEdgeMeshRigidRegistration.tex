\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes a contribution to the Insight Toolkit intended to
support the process of registering two Meshes.  The methods included here are
restricted to Meshes with a Spherical geometry and topology, and with scalar
values associated to their nodes.

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.
This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must
facilitate \textbf{reproducibility} of the reported results.

\section{Introduction}

The Insight Toolkit already provides methods for registering

\begin{itemize}
\item Image to Image
\item PointSet to Image
\item PointSet to PointSet
\end{itemize}

but it lacks methods for registering one Mesh versus another Mesh.

In this paper we contribute new classes that can be used for performing
registration between two spherical meshes, although not all of of the classes
in this contribution are restricted to be used on spherical meshes.

\section{Overview}

The design of these classes follows very closely the one of the Image
Registration Framework in ITK.  In particular, we have the usual components

\begin{itemize}
\item Optimizer
\item Metric
\item Transform
\item Interpolator
\end{itemize}

and we have the two objects to be registered, in this case Meshes instead of
Images. The two main components that must be provided in order to support Mesh
registration are Iterpolators and Metrics.

\subsection{Mesh Interpolators}

Mesh-based Interpolators are designed here following the same structure of the
image interpolators. In particular, they derive from the \doxygen{Function}
class, and implement a sequence of 

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{itk::MeshFunction}
\item \code{itk::InterpolateMeshFunction}
\end{itemize}

 and finally, the siblings

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{itk::LinearInterpolateMeshFunction}
\item \code{itk::NearestNeighborInterpolateMeshFunction}
\end{itemize}

The diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:InterpolatorsClassHierarchy} presents the hierarchy of mesh
interpolators that are included in this contribution.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Mesh Metrics}

Mesh metrics follow a similar structure to the existing image metrics in ITK.
Their hierarchy starts with the \code{itk::MeshToMeshMetric} that derives from
the existing ITK class \doxygen{SingleValuedCostFunction}. They currently comprise
an abstract base class and a concrete class, as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{itk::MeshToMeshMetric}
\item \code{itk::MeanSquaresMeshToMeshMetric}
\end{itemize}

It is expected that variations of Mesh metrics will be added as siblings of the
mean squares metric, just as variations of image metrics thrived in ITK.

The diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:MetricsClassHierarchy} presents the hierarchy of mesh
interpolators that are included in this contribution.
