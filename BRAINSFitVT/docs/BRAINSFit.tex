\noindent
The University of Iowa's Psychiatric Iowa Neuroimaging Consortium
(PINC) has developed a program for mutual information registration of
\brainstwoprog{} \cite{magnotta:brains2} data using \bcode{ITK}
\cite{ibanez:ITKSoftwareGuide14} classes, called \miregprog{}.  \par
We have written a helper class,
\bcode{itk::MultiModal3DMutualRegistrationHelper} to simplify
implementation and testing of different transform representations and
optimizers.  We have added a transform meeting the \bcode{ITK}
standard, \bcode{itk::ScaleVersor3DTransform}.  \miregprog{} is based
on the registration examples from \bcode{ITK}, but adds new features,
including the ability to employ different transform representations
and optimization functions.  \par Our goal was to determine best
practices for registering 3D rigid multimodal MRI of the human
brain. A version of the current program is employed here at PINC daily
for automated processing of acquired brain images.

\section{Automating the Image Registration Process}

We have developed a program for mutual information registration 
of brain imaging data
using \bcode{ITK} \cite{ibanez:ITKSoftwareGuide14} classes.
Our program, \miregprog{}, was based on an example program included in
the \bcode{ITK} distribution,
\begin{verbatim}
Insight/Examples/Registration/ImageRegistration8.cxx
\end{verbatim}
This program is the most functional example of multi-modal
3D rigid image registration provided with \bcode{ITK}.
\bcode{ImageRegistration8} is in the \bcode{Examples} directory, 
and also sec. 8.5.3 in the \bcode{ITK} manual.

\vspace{0.25in}\par
We have modified and extended this example in several ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item defined a new itk Transform class, based on \bcode{itkScaleSkewVersor3DTransform}
which has $3$ dimensions of scale but no skew aspect.

\item implemented a set of functions to convert between \bcode{Versor}
  Transforms and the general \bcode{itk::AffineTransform} and deferred
  converting from specific to more general representations to preserve 
  transform information specificity as long as possible.  Our Rigid transform
  is the narrowest, a Versor rotation plus separate translation.

\item Added a template class
  \bcode{itkMultiModal3DMutualRegistrationHelper} which is templated
  over the type of \bcode{ITK} transform generated, and the optimizer
  used.

\item Added image masks as an optional input to the Registration
  algorithm, limiting the volume considered during registration to
  voxels within the brain.

\item Added image mask generation as an optional input to the Registration
  algorithm when meaningful masks such as for whole brain are not available, 
  allowing the fit to at least be focussed on whole head tissue.

\item Added the ability to use one transform result, such as the Rigid transform,
 to initialize a more adaptive transform

\item Defined the command line parameters using tools from the
  Slicer \cite{pieper:slicer3} program, in order to conform to the \bcode{Slicer3}
  Execution model.

\item Added the ability to write output images in any \bcode{ITK}-supported scalar image format.

\item Through extensive testing as part of the \brainstwoprog{}
  determined reasonable defaults for registration algorithm parameters.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.25in}\par

\subsection{A new transform class}
\bcode{itkScaleVersor3DTransform} is a new \bcode{ITK Transform}
class, which is a modification of
\bcode{itkScaleSkewVersor3DTransform} to remove the skew factors from
the transform.  The result is a 9-parameter transform, comprising
three dimensions each of rotation, translation and scale.
\bcode{itkScaleVersor3DTransform} is particularly useful in
registration of brain images, which commonly have symmetric size
variations in all three dimensions.

\subsection{Conversion Routines for Versor transform types to Affine}
We implemented a \bcode{vnl\_svd}-based $3 \times{} 3$ matrix orthonormalization
routine and use it when coercing our \bcode{itkScaleVersor3DTransform} to an
\bcode{itkVersorRigid3DTransform}.  In addition, we implemented
assignment functions for converting all supported transform types to
\bcode{itk::AffineTransform}. This was originally a requirement for
integration with \brainstwoprog{}, but could be used in other programs
as well.

\subsection{A helper class to build an ITK pipeline}
The new class \bcode{itkMultiModal3DMutualRegistrationHelper}
encapsulates the complete processing pipeline for mutual information
registration.  This class is parameterized over the output transform
type, optimizer type, input image type and output image type.  This
class captures all of the code common to all forms of the Mutual
Information Registration algorithm, such that only high-level
configuration parameters need be specified by the calling program.

This allows the \bcode{MattesMutualInformation} program to be a
concise workbench for evaluating and using different transform and
optimizer types.

\subsection{Using Masks for Registration}
\bcode{itk::ImageToImageMetric} and all of its descendents
(\bcode{itk::MattesMutualInformationImageToImageMetric}, for example)
can use mask images to limit the voxesl considered during registration to the
relevant region of the input and output regions. This can improve
performance somewhat, both in time consumed and the quality of the
resulting registration.  The origin \bcode{ImageRegistration8}
program didn't include a provision for using masks, so we added it.

Masks were so useful in obtaining a more accurate optimizing convergence
that we added automatic generation of whole head tissue masks as well.

\subsection{Using the Slicer3 Execution Model for command line
  parameters}
The Slicer3 Execution Model is a way for a program to function as both
a command line program, as as a subroutine within the Slicer3
environment.  The command line parameters are specified in an XML file
that includes documentation/help strings. This file is read by the
\bcode{Slicer3} utility \bcode{GenerateCLP} which generates the code
for handling the program's command line. In addition to command line
parsing, it can reproduce the XML describing all parameters, which
Slicer3 can us to build a user interface panel for the program.

\subsection{Output Image Pixel Types}
We added the command line parameter \bcode{--OutputImagePixelType}, which specifies one of \bcode{float},\bcode{short},\bcode{ushort},\bcode{int},\bcode{uint},\bcode{char}, or \bcode{uchar}.   The most common image pixel types for MRI brain scans is 16 bit integers (bcode{short}) or unsigned 8 bit char (\bcode{uchar}), but \miregprog{} internally uses single precision floating point pixels for the registration process. Consequently, by default \miregprog{} writes out images with single precision pixels.  

\subsection{Tuning of default program parameters}
The program presented in this project has been used for some time as
part of the standard image processing pipeline used at the University
of Iowa for brain imaging studies.  Using image registration programs
is in general somewhat difficult because of the large number of
parameters to the registration algorithm that need to be tweaked to
get meaningful results.  

As a result of the Iowa experience with using this MutualRegistration
program, we have set program default parameters to the set of
parameters deemed the best behaved over the course of registering many
scans. A good registration fit is in most cases attained with no more
program input than the fixed and moving image file names and the
output transform and/or image filename.
\section{Example Run}
The \miregprog{} distribution contains a directory named \bcode{TestData}, which contains two example images.  The first, \bcode{test.nii.gz} is a \bcode{NIfTI} format image volume, which is used the input for the \bcode{CTest}-managed regression test program.  The program \bcode{makexfrmedImage.cxx}, included in the \miregprog{} distribution was used to generate \bcode{test2.nii.gz}, by scaling, rotating and translating \bcode{test.nii.gz}.

You can see representative Sagittal slices of \bcode{test.nii.gz} (in this case, the fixed image, \bcode{test2.nii.gz} (the moving image), and the two images 'checkerboarded' together in Figure~\ref{fig:reginputs}.  To register \bcode{test2.nii.gz} to \bcode{test.nii.gz}, you can use the following command:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
BRAINSFit --fixedVolume test.nii.gz \
--movingVolume test2.nii.gz \
--outputVolume registered.nii.gz \
--transformType Affine 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\parbox{\textwidth}
{A representative slice of the registered results image \bcode{registered.nii.gz} is in the center of Figure~\ref{fig:regoutputs}. You can see from the Checkerboard of the Fixed and Registered images that the fit is quite good with Affine transform-based registration.  The blurring of the registered images is a consequence of the initial scaling used in generating the moving image from the fixed image, compounded by the interpolation necessitated by the transform operation.

You can see the differences in results if you re-run \bcode{BRAINSFit} using \bcode{Rigid}, \bcode{ScaleVersor3D}, or \bcode{ScaleSkewVersor3D} as the \bcode{----transformType} parameter.  In this case, the authors judged \bcode{Affine} the best method for registering these particular two images;  in the \brainstwoprog{} automated processing pipeline, \bcode{Rigid} usually works well for registering research scans.}

\section{Software Requirements}

\miregprog{} depends on the Insight Toolkt, version 3.4 or later, and
CMake 2.4 or later. See the build instructions below; \miregprog{} is
distributed with build scripts that can automatically retrieve the
source code for both \bcode{ITK} and \bcode{CMake} and build them as
part of the \miregprog{} build process.  

You can also install \bcode{ITK} and \bcode{CMake} separately and use
the usual CMake configure-build-install process if you are comfortable
doing that.

The build script is written in the \bcode{TCL} scripting language, so
\bcode{Tcl} needs to be installed to run that script. Ready-to-install
\bcode{TCL} binaries are available from
\url{thtp://www.activestate.com/activetcl} or \url{http://www.equi4.com/pub/tk/downloads.html}.

% You need to have the following software installed:

% % The {itemize} environment uses a bullet for each \item.  If you want the 
% % \item's numbered, use the {enumerate} environment instead.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item  Insight Toolkit 3.4.
%   \item  CMake 2.4.
% \end{itemize}

% If you do not already have \bcode{ITK} and \bcode{CMake} installed, they can obtained via the Insight Toolkit Website: \url{http://www.itk.org}.

% Note that other versions of the Insight Toolkit are also available in the
% testing framework of the Insight Journal. Please refere to the following page
% for details:

% \small
% \url{http://www.insightsoftwareconsortium.org/wiki/index.php/IJ-Testing-Environment}
% \normalsize

% If you wish to add to or modify the command line parameters, you will need the \bcode{GenerateCLP} program which is part of the \bcode{Slicer3} application.  Refer to the following pages for details:

% \small
% \url{http://www.slicer.org}\par
% \url{http://www.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/Slicer3:Execution_Model_Documentation}
% \normalsize

\section{Building BRAINSFit}
The normal steps for building and installing \miregprog{} are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item make a 'sandbox' directory in which to build \miregprog{}.
\item change to that sandbox directory
\item Untar (or checkout from version control) the \miregprog{} distribution.
\item run \bcode{BRAINSFit/BuildScripts/getbuildtest.tcl}.
\item Optionally, install the program
\end{itemize}

The following shell script accomplishes all these steps, except installation:
\begin{verbatim}
# Create a directory to hold source and build directory
mkdir -p BRAINSFit-sandbox
cd BRAINSFit-sandbox

#
# check BRAINSFit out from the NITRC svn server 
svn checkout https://www.nitrc.org/svn/multimodereg BRAINSFit
#
# run the build script.
tclsh BRAINSFit/BuildScripts/getbuildtest.tcl

\end{verbatim}

\section{Project Home on NITRC.org}
The \miregprog{} project is hosted on \url{http://www.nitrc.org}, The Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse.  The project page itself is 

\url{http://www.nitrc.org/projects/multimodereg}

NITRC is a project of the US National institutes of Health, started to give researchers access to neuroimaging software tools.  Every project on NITRC has a variety of resources presented on the project page: a source code repository, bug tracker, mailing lists, forums, etc.

The most current source code (including the LaTex source files for this document) are always available from the project page given above.  Users are encouraged to register on the NITRC page, so they can ask questions, make feature requests, share use experiences, and contribute bug reports.
