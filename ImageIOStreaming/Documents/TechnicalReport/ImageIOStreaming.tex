\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes an improvement in the Image IO implementation of the
Insight Toolkit ITK. The toolkit as a whole supports streaming data accross
filters with the purpose of allowing to perform image processing in large
images by loading them by pieces and processing every piece independently.

Unfortunately, the implementation of streaming was not usable due to the lack
of support at the level of the readers. This report describes the modifications
that must be applied to the Image IO infrastructure in order to support
streaming at read time.
