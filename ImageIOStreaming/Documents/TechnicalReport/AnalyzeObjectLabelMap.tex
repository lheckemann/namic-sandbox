\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes an addition to the Image IO Source of the Insight Toolkit ITK.
ITK has been able to read in Anaylze image files but not the object maps that correspond
to the images.  Without the object maps, regions of interest were not being shown.
These regions of interest are helpful in desginating locations and giving a name to those
locations, which is useful if you are trying to tell someone where to look in an image.
This report describes the reason why this code should be added into ITK and how to use the code.
