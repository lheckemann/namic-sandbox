		\noindent This paper describes the Insight Toolkit (ITK) Conformal
		Flattening filter: itkConformalFlatteningFilter. This ITK filter is an
		implementation of a paper by Sigurd Angenent, et al., ``On the
		Laplace-Beltrami Operator and Brain Surface Flattening''
		\cite{angenent1999lbo}. This filter performs an angle preserving map of any
		genus zero (i.e. no handles) triangulated mesh to the sphere or,
		alternatively, to the plane. In other words, any given triangle in the
		resulting sphere will have the same angles as the corresponding
		triangle in the original mesh, though their areas may differ. In this
		paper, we describe our code and provide the user with enough details
		to reproduce the results which we present in this paper. This filter
		has a variety of applications including the flattening of brain
		surfaces, which was the initial motivation for this work.

	\tableofcontents

	The folding and wrapping of brain surfaces presents researchers with
	difficulties in obtaining a more intuition-based surface rendering and
	in measuring distances on the brain surface. In recent years, a number
	of methods have been proposed to map the brain surface to a plane or a
	sphere. Most of the previous methods are derived to preserve local
	area or length. In the paper of Sigurd Angenent, et al., ``On the
	Laplace-Beltrami Operator and Brain Surface Flattening'', an angle
	preserving conformal flattening scheme is proposed.

	The algorithm obtains the explicit form of the flattening map by
	solving a partial differential equation on the surface using the
	finite element method (FEM). The mapping is a bijection and the
	original structure can be restored by inverse mapping.

	\section{Algorithm Details}

	\subsection{Mathematical manipulation}
  Denote the genus zero surface which is to be flattened as $\Sigma$.
  $\Sigma$ can be mapped to a plane using the algorithm proposed in
  \cite{angenent1999lbo}. The mapping is conformal thus the angles are
  preserved. Furthermore, the plane can be mapped to a sphere, using
  standard stereographic projection.
  
  It is proven in the appendix of \cite{angenent1999lbo} that the mapping
  $z$, defined on $\Sigma$, satisfying is the following:
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \triangle z = (\frac{\partial}{\partial u} - i\frac{\partial}{\partial v})\delta_p 
    \label{pde}
  \end{eqnarray}
  
  where $p$ is an (arbitrary) point on $\Sigma$. The funtion $z$ maps
  $\Sigma \backslash \{p\}$ to the complex plane $\mathbf{C}$. Then by
  standard sterographic projection, the complex plane is mapped to a
  sphere excluding only the north pole.

  \subsection{Numerical scheme}
  The mapping $z$ is defined on the surface. In the numerical
  manipulation where the surface is denoted as a triangulated mesh,
  solving of the equation (\ref{pde}) is carried out by FEM.
  
  In the discrete configuration, $z$ is approximated by a piecewise
  linear function on the triangulated mesh. Denote the
  finite-dimensional space $PL(\Sigma)$ of piecewise linear functions
  on $\Sigma$. To solve equation (\ref{pde}), first its right side
  should be approximated. For any function $f$ smooth in a
  neighborhood of $p$,
  \begin{eqnarray}
    && \int\int_{\Sigma} f (\frac{\partial}{\partial u} - i\frac{\partial}{\partial v})\delta_p \mathrm{d}S \nonumber \\
    &=& - \int\int_{\Sigma}(\frac{\partial}{\partial u} - i\frac{\partial}{\partial v})f \delta_p(w) \mathrm{d}S \nonumber \\
    &=& -(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} - i\frac{\partial f}{\partial v})\delta_p \label{rightSideOfPDE}
  \end{eqnarray}  
  Thus $\forall f \in PL(\Sigma)$, given that the point $p$ lies in
  the cell composed by three points $A$, $B$, and $C$, the quantity of
  (\ref{rightSideOfPDE}) is determined by the values of $f$ on $A$,
  $B$, and $C$.
  
  On the triangle $\triangle ABC$, choose the $u$ and $v$ axes such
  that $A$ and $B$ are along $u$ axis and the positive direction of
  axis $v$ is pointing to the point $C$. So,
  \begin{eqnarray}    
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} &=& \frac{f_B - f_A}{||B - A||} \nonumber \\
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial v} &=& \frac{f_C - f_E}{||C - E||} \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}  
  in which E is the orthogonal projection of $C$ on $AB$ and can be
  computed by:
  \begin{eqnarray}  
    E = A + \theta(B-A) \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}  
  where
  \begin{eqnarray}  
    \theta = \frac{<C-A, B-A>}{||B-A||^2} \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}  
  in which $<,>$ denotes inner product.
  
  Thus $\forall f \in PL(\Sigma)$, 
  \begin{eqnarray}  
    (\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} - i\frac{\partial f}{\partial v})\delta_p = 
    \frac{f_A - f_B}{|| B - A ||} + i\frac{f_c-(f_A + \theta(f_B - f_A))}{||C - E||} \label{Rinteqn}
  \end{eqnarray}  
  
  Next we are going to perform the finite element solution of the
  mapping in the function space $PL(\Sigma)$.
  
  FEM theory indicates that the solver function $z=x+iy$ for equation
  (\ref{pde}) is the minimizer of the Dirichlet functional:
  \begin{eqnarray}  
    \mathbf{D}(z):=\frac{1}{2}\int\int_{\Sigma}[ |\nabla z|^2 + 2z (\frac{\partial}{\partial u} - i\frac{\partial}{\partial v})\delta_p ]\mathrm{d}S \label{DirichletFunctional}
  \end{eqnarray}      
  $z$ satisfies equation(\ref{pde}) if and only if $\forall$ smooth
  function $f$,
  \begin{eqnarray}  
    \int\int_{\Sigma} \nabla z \cdot \nabla f \mathrm{d}S = (\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} - i\frac{\partial f}{\partial v})|_p \label{FEM}
  \end{eqnarray}    
  To find the function in $PL(\Sigma)$ satisfying equation(\ref{FEM}),
  we define a set of basis $\phi_P$ in the $PL(\Sigma)$ as,
  \begin{eqnarray}  
    \phi_P(P) &=& 1 \nonumber \\
    \phi_P(Q) &=& 0, \forall Q \ne P \nonumber \\
    \phi_P(P) && is \quad linear \quad on \quad each \quad triangle \label{basis}
  \end{eqnarray}  
  Then function $z$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the
  basis:
  \begin{eqnarray}  
    z = \sum_{P:\quad vertex \quad of \quad \Sigma} z_P \phi_P \label{zInBasis}
  \end{eqnarray}  
  By this we convert the original problem into solving for the complex
  vector $\vec{z}=(z_P)$:
  \begin{eqnarray}  
    \sum_P z_P \int\int \nabla \phi_P \cdot \nabla \phi_Q \mathrm{d}S = \frac{\partial \phi_Q}{\partial u}(p) - i \frac{\partial \phi_Q}{\partial v}(p)
    \label{allQ}
  \end{eqnarray}  
  Denote matrix $D_{PQ}$ as
  \begin{eqnarray}  
    D_{PQ} = \int\int \nabla \phi_P \cdot \nabla \phi_Q \mathrm{d}S  \label{Dpq}
  \end{eqnarray}  
  The off-diagonal elements of $D$ can be computed by:
  \begin{eqnarray}  
    \{ \mathbf{D} \}_{P,Q } = -\frac{1}{2}(ctg\angle R + ctg\angle S), \quad P \ne Q  \label{ctg}
  \end{eqnarray}  
  \begin{figure}
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=7cm]{PntPQRS.eps} \caption{Triangle} \label{PntPQRS}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}  
  The points are illustrated in figure (\ref{PntPQRS}).  
  
  Also, since
  \begin{eqnarray}  
    \sum_P D_PQ = \sum_P \int \nabla \phi_P \cdot \nabla \phi_Q = \int \nabla 1 \cdot \nabla \phi_Q = 0
  \end{eqnarray}
  Thus the diagonal elements of matrix D can be obtained by:
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \mathbf{D}_{PP} = -\sum_{P \ne Q}D_PQ \label{diagonalOfD}
  \end{eqnarray}    
  Write each $z_p$ as $z_p=x_p + iy_p$, then
  equation (\ref{allQ}) can be written separately as:
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \sum_{P}x_p D_{PQ} &=& \frac{\partial \Phi(Q)}{\partial u}(P) \nonumber\\
    \sum_{Q}y_p D_{PQ} &=& -\frac{\partial \Phi(Q)}{\partial v} (P)
  \end{eqnarray}  
  denote:
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \vec{a} = (a_Q) &=& \frac{\partial \Phi(Q)}{\partial u}(P) \nonumber \\
    \vec{b} = (b_Q) &=& -\frac{\partial \Phi(Q)}{\partial v} (P)
  \end{eqnarray}  
  so we have:
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \mathbf{D}\vec{x} &=& \vec{a} \nonumber \\
    \mathbf{D}\vec{y} &=& \vec{b} \label{z}
  \end{eqnarray}    
  $\forall \quad point \quad Q$:
  \begin{eqnarray}
    a_Q - ib_Q := \left\{
    \begin{array}{lcl}
      0 & for & Q \notin {A, B, C} \\
      \frac{-1}{||B-A||} + i\frac{1-\theta}{||C-E||} & for & Q = A \\
      \frac{1}{||B-A||} + i\frac{\theta}{||C-E||} & for & Q = B \\
      i\frac{-1}{||C-E||} & for & Q = C
    \end{array} \right. \label{ab}
  \end{eqnarray}      
	With vectors $a$, $b$, and matrix $D$, we can solve the linear
	equation to obtain the mapping. The matrix $D$ is sparce, symmetric
	and positively defined, hence is suitable to being solved by the
	conjugate gradient method.

	\section{User's Guide}

	The conformal flattening filter takes an ITK mesh as input and will
	generate another ITK mesh as output. The usage is basically the same
	as other mesh to mesh filters in ITK.

	\subsection{Basic usage}
	The filter is instaintiated by:
	\begin{verbatim}
		typedef itk::ConformalFlatteningFilter< MeshType, MeshType>  FilterType;
		FilterType::Pointer filter = FilterType::New();
	\end{verbatim}
	Then the input can be set and result can be obtained by:
	\begin{verbatim}
		filter->SetInput( mesh ); 
	\end{verbatim}
	and
	\begin{verbatim}
		newMesh = filter->GetOutput(); 
	\end{verbatim}

	\subsection{More about APIs}
	The filter has two categories of APIs for further manipulation. The
	first one is the setPointP function and the second contains two switch
	functions, mapToPlane and mapToSphere.

	On the right side of equation (\ref{pde}), the $\delta_p$ function
	depands on the location of the point \emph{p}. Basically, this point
	will be mapped to infinity on the plane and the north-pole of the
	sphere. Hence the selection of the point \emph{p} determines which
	patch on the original mesh is mapped up to the north pole.

	The API setPointP takes an integer as input indicating the cell number
	in which the point \emph{p} lies. It's a good choice to set the point
	\emph{p} where the local surface is relatively flat, i.e., having a
	small local curvature. However the computation of curvature can be
	done by the vtkCurvatures filter. In order to make this filter
	independent of VTK, this feature is not included in the filter and is
	left to the user. If setting the point \emph{p} at some flat area is
	crucial, we suggest that user first use vtkCurvatures to obtain the
	number of cells having low curvatures and then call this function
	using one of the cells with a low curvature.

	The switch functions mapToPlane and mapToSphere determine the output
	to be either a plane or a sphere, the sphere being the default. The
	difference between the two mappings is simply a stereographic
	projection from the plane to the sphere. Simply by
	\begin{verbatim}
		filter->mapToSphere( ); 
	\end{verbatim}
	or
	\begin{verbatim}
		filter->mapToPlane( ); 
	\end{verbatim}
	users can switch between two different outputs.

	\section{Conclusions}
	In this paper, we have described the Insight Toolkit (ITK) Conformal
	Flattening filter: itkConformalFlatteningFilter. This ITK filter is an
	implementation of a paper by Sigurd Angenent, et al., ``On the
	Laplace-Beltrami Operator and Brain Surface Flattening''
	\cite{angenent1999lbo}. This filter performs an angle preserving map of any
	genus zero (i.e. no handles) triangulated mesh to the sphere or,
	alternatively, to the plane.

	We have provide the user with details to be able to reproduce our
	results. We have also given suggestions as to how to exploit the full
	functionality of this filter.

	In the future, we propose to use this filter to map entire brain
	surfaces to the sphere. Perhaps clinical studies of the resulting
	flattened map with yield insights into brain anatomy and function.
