# Revision 1.19  2006/05/13 19:33:01  anton
# CMake configuration: Preliminary support for directory names with spaces.
# See ticket #226
#
# Revision 1.18  2006/02/13 22:20:39  ofri
# main CMakeLists and cisstBuild export: include all the cisstNetlib libraries
# into one variable CISSTNETLIB_LIBRARIES in the EXPORTED variables.
#
# Revision 1.17  2005/11/20 21:35:18  kapoor
# LAPACK: Added CISST_HAS_CISSTCNETLIB flag to cmake, which can be used to
# compile code using the newer LAPACK3E. CLAPACK is still supported. See
# ticket #193.
#
# Revision 1.16  2005/09/06 02:08:14  anton
# CMake configuration: Created a main CMakeLists.txt for the libs, tests and
# examples.  A lot of code has been "factorized" in the ./CMakeLists.txt.
# Known problems: "doc" is not working yet. Dependencies on SWIG projects don't
# work for parallel builds. If a lib is selected and then unselected, the tests
# still appear ...
#
# Revision 1.15  2005/06/20 22:14:57  anton
# cisstBuild and cisstInstalled.cmake: Typos in Python libraries variables.
#
# Revision 1.14  2005/06/17 23:04:46  anton
# cisst CMake code: Propagation of Python settings to tests and examples.
#
# Revision 1.13  2005/06/17 21:30:24  anton
# cisst CMake code:  Major update to ease the configuration of tests and
# examples.
#
# Revision 1.12  2005/05/19 19:29:00  anton
# cisst libs: Added the license to cisstCommon and cisstVector
#
# Revision 1.11  2004/11/01 17:44:48  anton
# cisstNumerical: Added some Solvers and the files to use our own cnetlib
# code added to the cisst CVS repository (module "cnetlib").
#
# Revision 1.10  2004/10/27 14:40:35  anton
# CMake configuration: Added code to compile netlib and reorganized the way
# new header files are created/copied.
#
# Revision 1.9  2004/10/07 18:26:34  anton
# CMake build process: Added a #define CISST_BUILD_LINK_DIRECTORIES so that
# build executable can define a path to dynamically load libraries (e.g.
# Python modules).  Also added CISST_SWIG_INCLUDE_DIR so that one can
# import the .i files for SWIG.
#
# Revision 1.8  2004/10/06 19:53:11  anton
# cisstBuild.cmake and cmakeInstalled.cmake: Try to have a more precise
# link option (i.e. par target, not for all targets).  This might require
# to use CISST_REQUIRES after the new target is added (i.e. after
# ADD_EXECUTABLE(...)).
#
# Revision 1.7  2004/05/04 14:08:27  anton
# Added CISST_REQUIRES macro
#
# Revision 1.6  2004/03/29 21:21:02  anton
# All variables start with CISST to be consistant
#
# Revision 1.5  2004/01/22 21:55:54  anton
# cmake/cisstMacros.cmake
#
# Revision 1.4  2003/10/15 16:07:35  anton
# Added specific directory for Doxygen
#
# Revision 1.3  2003/09/17 14:12:02  anton
# added flag to determine if the libraries are shared
#
# Revision 1.2  2003/08/06 14:00:21  anton
# Removed the LINK and INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, just use SET so that the cmake file which include these can decide what to do.
#
# Revision 1.1  2003/07/31 18:17:03  anton
# Creation
