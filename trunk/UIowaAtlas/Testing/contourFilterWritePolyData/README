Synopsis:
  ./contourFilterPolyDataWriter inputImageFileName.img outputPolyDataFileName.vtp

This program uses ITK to read in an Analyze 7.5 image.  It then converts this to 
a VTK image and uses a vtkContourFilter to create vtkPolyData, which is written
to the user-specified .vtp file using a vtkPolyDataWriter.
