 *** Method

These results were obtained by running lsSeg method with the default
parameters. Two-step segmentation -- feature map generation followed by
geodesic level set segmentation.

 *** Parameters

Only initial seed was specified.

ITK did not preserve the origin and spacing in the images, so they cannot be
overlapped with the input data in Slicer.

 *** Execution time

Depends on the front propagation extent. Case 08 is the slowest and worst
because of non-round shape of the tumor.

 *** Platform

Same as method 1
