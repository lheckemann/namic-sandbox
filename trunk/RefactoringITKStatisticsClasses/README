To test all the projects in the statistics framework

1. Build as usual with cmake

2. Run RunTests.sh . The script will be found in the Tests/ folder in the binary directory that you just created





PS:---------
If you wish to run individual tests, you can go to the Tests/ folder in the binary directory and
   ./itkStatisticsTests
will list the set of available tests. You may have to specify the arguments
yourself for some tests as in 
   ./itkStatisticsTests itkImageToCooccurrenceListAdaptorTest /home/karthik/work/ITK/src/Insight/Testing/Data/Input/HeadMRVolume.mhd
