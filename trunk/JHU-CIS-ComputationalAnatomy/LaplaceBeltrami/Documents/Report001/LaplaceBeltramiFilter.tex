\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes a contribution to the Insight Toolkit intended to
support the process of statistical analysis in Computational Anatomy.
The methods included here are
restricted to closed, triagulated surfaces (represented by a QuadEdgeMesh) 
with a Spherical geometry and
topology.  The filter assigns basis function values as Point Data on each 
vertex of the Mesh.

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.
This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must
facilitate \textbf{reproducibility} of the reported results.

\section{Introduction}

In the field of Computational Anatomy the shape of biological structures are
compared mathematically between subjects.  The difference or similarity in shape
between subject structures is quantified and correlations between shape and
disease can be produced and examined for statistical significance.

It is desirable to reduce the dimensionality of statistical comparisons
between subjects, but maintain information that might be valuable in finding
correlations between shape and pathology.  A surface mesh can be represented in
a way that its $N$ most significant surface harmonics can be compared with other
subjects.

The purpose of this filter is to use the Laplace-Beltrami operator to determine
surface harmonics in terms of PointData at each vertex.  In the same way that
a sound signal can be approximately characterized by a combination of its most
significant frequency components, so can a surface be expressed as a combination
of its surface harmonics.  This filter determines the requested $N$ most
significant harmonics.


\section{Overview}

The filter described in this report operates on \doxygen{QuadEdgeMesh}
data, and provides
the requested basis function as PointData in a copy of the Input Mesh.



\section{Algorithm For Approximation of the Laplacian on Triangulated Surfaces}

The basic algorithm implemented in this filter is based on \cite{Qiu06} and
is similar to \cite{Levy09}.  The algorithm visits all the
faces of the triangulated mesh, determining each face's area and the areas of
the associated vertices, then computes the laplacian operator as a sparse
matrix over the vertices.

Let $S$ be a triangulated surface with faces $f\in F$ and vertices
$v\in V$. Let $\psi$ be a function defined on vertices. We want to
define the laplacian of $\psi$.

First define the gradient, defined as a function indexed by {\em faces}. Let
$e_1, e_2, e_3$ be three edges forming a face $f$ (with the correct
orientation). Let $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ be its vertices so that $e_1 =
v_3- v_2$, $e_2=v_1 - v_3$ and $e_3 = v_2 - v_1$. Let $c =
(e_1+e_2+e_3)/3$ be the center of the face.

Define the gradient $u = \nabla\psi(f)$ on the face by $u = \al_1 e_1 + \al_2 e_2$
such that $u\cdot (v_k-c) = \psi(v_k) - \psi(c)$ for $k=1,2,3$, with
$\psi(c) := (\psi(v_1) + \psi(v_2) +\psi(v_3))/3$. Since this implies
that $u\cdot (v_k-v_l) = \psi(v_k) - \psi(v_l)$, this gives
\begin{eqnarray*}
\psi(v_3) - \psi(v_2)  &=& (\al_1 e_1 + \al_2 e_2) \cdot e_1\\
\psi(v_1) - \psi(v_3) &=& (\al_1 e_1 + \al_2 e_2) \cdot e_2
\end{eqnarray*}
Let $\psi_f$ be the column vector $[\psi(v_1), \psi(v_2),
\psi(v_3)]^T$, $M$ the 2 by 3 matrix
$$
M = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 1\\ 1 & 0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
and $G_f$ the matrix 
$$
G_f = \begin{pmatrix} |e_1|^2 & e_1\cdot e_2\\ e_1\cdot e_2 & |e_2|^2
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
With this notation, the previous system is $M\psi_f = G_f \al$;
this implies $|u|^2 = \al^T
G_f\al = \psi_f^T M^T G_f^{-1} M \psi_f$.

First note that $\det G_f = |e_1|^2\,|e_2|^2  - (e_1\cdot e_2)^2 =
(|e_1||e_2|\sin\th_3)^2$ where $\th_3$ is the angle at $v_3$. It is
therefore equal to $4 a(f)^2$ where $a(f)$ is the area of $f$. Now
\begin{eqnarray*}
M^T G_f^{-1} M &=& \det(G_f)^{-1} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 &0  \\ 1 & -1
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} |e_2|^2 & -e_1\cdot e_2\\ -e_1\cdot e_2 & |e_1|^2
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 1\\ 1 & 0 & -1
\end{pmatrix} 
\\
&=& \det(G_f)^{-1} \begin{pmatrix} |e_1|^2 & e_1\cdot e_2 &
  e_1\cdot e_3 \\ e_1\cdot e_2 & |e_2|^2 & e_2\cdot e_3 \\ e_1\cdot
  e_3 & e_2\cdot e_3 & |e_3|^2
\end{pmatrix}
\end{eqnarray*}
after computation and using $e_3 = - e_1 - e_2$. Let $\Sig_f$
denote this last matrix. We can write the approximation:
$$
\int_S |\nabla \psi(s)|^2d\sig(s) \simeq \sum_{f\in F}  \psi_f^T M^T
G_f^{-1} M \psi_f a(f) = \sum_{f\in F} \frac{\psi_f^T\Sig_f\psi_f}{4a(f)} .
$$

We want to identify the operator $\psi \mapsto \Delta\psi$ (the
discrete Laplacian on $S$) such that 
\[
\sum_{f\in F} \frac{\psi_f^T\Sig_f\psi_f}{4a(f)} = - \sum_{v\in V} \psi(v) (\Delta\psi)(v)
a(v).
\] 
where $a(v)$ is the area attributed to vertex $v$, that can be defined
by $a(v) = (1/3) \sum_{f:v\in f} a(f)$. We can write: 
$$
\sum_{f\in F} \frac{\psi_f^T\Sig_f\psi_f}{4a(f)} = \frac14\sum_{v\in V}\psi(v) \sum_{f: v\in f} (|e(v)|^2 \psi(v) + e(v)\cdot e({v'})
\psi(v') + e(v)\cdot e(v'')
\psi(v'') ) / a(f)
$$
where $e(v)$ is the edge opposed to $v$ in face $f$ and $v'$ and $v''$ are
the other two vertices in $f$. This means that one should define
\[
\Delta \psi(v) = - \frac1{4a(v)}\sum_{f: v\in f} (|e(v)|^2 \psi(v) + e(v)\cdot e({v'})
\psi(v') + e(v)\cdot e(v'')
\psi(v'') ) / a(f)
\]
One can rewrite this discrete Laplacian in terms of angles. For a
vertex $v$ and a face $f$ such that $v\in f$, oriented as $f =
(v,v',v'')$, let $\th'_f(v)$ and
$\th''_f(v)$ denote the angles opposed to $v$ in $f$ ($\th'_f(v)$ is
the angle at $v'$ and $\th''_f(v)$ is
the angle at $v''$). With this
notation, one has (since $e_f(v) = v'' - v'$ and $e_f(v') = v - v''$)
\[
e_f(v)\cdot e_f(v') = - \cos(\th''_f(v)) |e_f(v)|\,|e_f(v')| = - 2{\mathrm cot}(\th''_f(v)) a(f)
\]
Similarly, $e_f(v)\cdot e_f(v'') =  - 2{\mathrm cot}(\th'_f(v)) a(f)$ and,
since the sum of edges is 0, 
\[
|e_f(v)|^2 = - e_f(v) \cdot (e_f(v') + e_f(v'')) = 2({\mathrm
  cot}(\th'(v)) + {\mathrm cot}(\th''(v))) a(f),
\]
One can therefore write
\[
\Delta \psi(v) =  \frac1{2a(v)}\sum_{f: v\in f} ({\mathrm cot}(\th''_f(v))
(\psi(v') - \psi(v)) + {\mathrm cot}(\th_f'(v))
(\psi(v'') - \psi(v)))
\]


These expressions allow us to write the Laplacian operator as a
sparse matrix indexed over the vertices of the triangulated
surface. Letting $V = (v_1, \ldots, v_N)$, define $A$ to be a sparse
matrix such that 
\[
\De \psi(v_k) = \sum_{l=1}^N A(k,l) \psi(v_l).
\]
($A$ is sparse since  $A(k,l) = 0$ if $k\neq l$ and $v_k$ and $v_l$ are not connected by
an edge.)
Besides the zeros, $A$ has the following entries. We first assume that
$S$ has no boundary, so that each edge belongs to exactly two faces. 
\begin{itemize}
\item If $(k,l)$ is an edge, we can define $\be_{kl}$ and
  $\be_{kl}'$ to be the two angles opposed to the edge in the two faces that
  contain it. Then 
\[
A(k,l) =  \frac1{2a(v_k)}  ({\mathrm cot}(\be_{kl}) +
{\mathrm cot}(\be_{kl}'))
\]
\item Then, $A(k,k) = - \sum_{l\neq k} A(k,l)$ i.e., 
\[
A(k,k) = - \frac{1}{2a(v_k)} \sum_{l \sim k}  ({\mathrm cot}(\be_{kl}) +
{\mathrm cot}(\be_{kl}'))
\]
where $l\sim k$ indicates that $l$ and $k$ are linked by an edge.
\end{itemize}


These definitions must be modified when surfaces have
boundaries. One usually works with two types of boundary conditions:
$\psi  = 0$ on the boundary of $S$ (Dirichlet boundary condition) or
$\nabla \psi$ tangent to the boundary of $S$ (von Neumann boundary
condition). 

For triangulated surfaces, Dirichlet boundary condition is directly
implemented by restricting to non-boundary vertices. For such
vertices, the formulae for $A(k,k)$ and $A(k,l)$ remain unchanged.

Von Neumann boundary condition can be discretized by adding dummy
faces  to the surfaces symmetrically to boundary edges. This results
in an extended surface $\tilde S$ and a function $\psi$ on $S$ can be
extended to $\tilde S$ by symmetry too. 

The resulting new definition of $A(k,l)$ is identical to the one with
closed surfaces if $(k,l)$ is an interior edge. If $(k,l)$ is a
boundary edge, then there is only one $\be_{kl}$ and $A(k,l) = 
{\mathrm cot}(\be_{kl}) /a(v_k)$ (so that the angle is counted twice). $A(k,k)$ is defined also in this
case by
\[
A(k,k) = - \sum_{l \sim k}  A(k,l).
\]
(Notice that this is not necessarily satisfied with the
Dirichlet boundary condition.)

\bigskip

Letting $D$ be the diagonal matrix with coefficients $D(k,k) = a(v_k)$,
then $B = DA$  is a symmetric matrix ($B$ is just defined like $A$
without the normalizations nu $a(v_k)$). Finding the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of $A$ is equivalent to solving the generalized
eigenvalue problem
\[
B\psi = \la D\psi.
\]
Defining $\tilde B(k,l) = B(k,l)/\sqrt{a(v_k) a(v_l)} $ so that
$\tilde B D^{-1/2} B D^{-1/2}$, this is
equivalent to solving the standard eigenvalue problem $\tilde B \tilde
\psi = \la \tilde \psi$ and to let $\psi(k) = \tilde\psi(k)
/\sqrt{a(v_k)}$. 

Finally, notice that the definition
\[
a(v) = \frac13 \sum_{f:v\in f} a(f)
\]
can be modified as
\[
a(v) = \sum_{f:v\in f} a_f(v)
\]
where $a_f(v)$ is the area of the {\em Vorono\"\i<F9>} {\em cell} of $v$ in
$f$ (region in the face for which points are closer to $v$ than to
the other two vertices).

The expression of $a_f(v)$ depends on whether $f$ is obtuse (has an
angle larger than $\pi/2$) or not.

In the non-obtuse case, one has (with the same notation as before)
\[
a_f(v) = \frac14 (|e_f(v')|^2 \mathrm{cot}(\th'_f(v)) + |e_f(v'')|^2
\mathrm{cot}(\th''_f(v))).
\] 
In the obtuse case, one must take
$a_f(v) = a(f)/2$ if $v$ is the obtuse angle and $a_f(v) = a(f)/4$ otherwise.

\section{Implementation}
This filter derives from \doxygen{QuadEdgeMeshToQuadEdgeMeshFilter}.  The input 
consists of a triangulated \doxygen{QuadEdgeMesh}.  Filter Data Generation code
calls \code{CopyInputMeshToOutputMesh} so the output of the filter is
structurally a copy of the input filter, of type \code{TOutputMesh}.
The filter uses \code{vnl\_sparse\_matrix} to contain the Laplacian
operator over the vertices.  To compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the
filter uses \code{vnl\_sparse\_symmetric\_eigensystem}.

\section{Usage}
This filter derives from \doxygen{QuadEdgeMeshToQuadEdgeMeshFilter}, so the user
needs to specify \code{TInputMesh} and \code{TOutputMesh} to instantiate the
class.
\small
\begin{verbatim}
    typedef float              PixelType;
    typedef double             PointDataType;
    typedef double             DDataType;
    typedef double             CoordRep;
    typedef double             InterpRep;
    const   unsigned int       Dimension = 3;

    // Declare the type of the input and output mesh
    typedef itk::QuadEdgeMeshTraits<PixelType, Dimension, PointDataType,
        DDataType, CoordRep, InterpRep> MeshTraits;
    typedef itk::QuadEdgeMesh<float,Dimension,MeshTraits> InMeshType;
    typedef itk::QuadEdgeMesh<double,Dimension,MeshTraits> OutMeshType;

    typedef itk::LaplaceBeltramiFilter< InMeshType, OutMeshType >
                                            LbFilterType;
    LbFilterType::Pointer lbFilter = LbFilterType::New();

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The input should be a triangulated \doxygen{QuadEdgeMesh} based object.
Meshes with polys of
more than 3 sides will generate an exception in \code{Update()}.
The user should specify the
number of surface harmonics (\code{lbFilter->SetEigenValueCount(eCount)}) 
to generate before updating the filter.
Once the filter data is generated (\code{lbFilter->Update()}), the user has
access to:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{GetLBOperator} - the sparse matrix of the Laplace operator over
the vertices
\item \code{GetHarmonics} - values for all the requested surface harmonics
over all the vertices
\item \code{SetSurfaceHarmonic} - set the point data of the output filter to
the values of the desired surface harmonic.  Call \code{GetOutput()} to access
this mesh.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
The results in this example can be obtained by executing the test program
\code{itkLaplaceBeltramiFilterTest2}:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
USAGE: itkLaplaceBeltramiFilterTest2 [OPTIONS] <vtk_mesh_file> <first_harmonic_surface>
            -h --help : print this message
            -e --eigenvalueCount : number of principal eigenvalues to calculate

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The program will determine the Laplacian Operator values for each matrix.  If
if the user specifies a harmonic count $N$ with \code{-e N} or 
\code{--eigenvalueCount N}, the program will produce $N$ .vtk files containing
the original mesh with the PointData set to the first $N$ surface harmonics.
The following example computes the first nine surface harmonics on the input
mesh \code{fvo.vtk}, a hippocampus surface.

\small
\begin{verbatim}

./itkLaplaceBeltramiFilterTest2 --eigenvalueCount 9 fv0.vtk lbOutput.vtk

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Figure~\ref{fig:HippocampusSurfaceHarmonics} shows the first nine output surface
harmonics displayed in CAWorks, a JHU Center for
Imaging Science Paraview-based application.
