Code has been tested with ITK 3.18.0 and VTK 5.6.0
on Windows XP and Windows 7 with Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.

FEM unit system: SI (mm) = mm - N - tonne (1000kg) - s - MPa (N/mm2) stress - mJ - tonne/mm3 density
(An alternative could be: SI = m - N - kg - s - Pa (N/m2) - J - kg/m3)

DefRegEval uses LPS coordinate system (according to ITK and DICOM standard).
If metaimages are opened in Slicer they are correctly converted to LPS.
To properly display STL files in Slicer an LPStoRAS transform shall be applied
on the model (-1 0 0 0; 0 -1 0 0; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1).
LPS: ITK, DICOM, meta files, ITKSnap ITK
RAS: Slicer, NIFTI, ITKSnap NIFTI
AnatomicalOrientation tag (such as RAI) in meta files are ignored (they are
assumed to be LPS)

It is recommended to use the precompiled solver in tools\febio\Release\FEBio.exe instead of the one that
is compiled from the source, because the precompiled version contains the more efficient pardiso solver.

On Linux, tetgen segfaults if compiled in the Release mode.
