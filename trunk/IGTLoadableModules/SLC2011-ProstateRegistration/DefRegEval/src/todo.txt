* Define char (externalimagetype) and other common image types in DefRegEval.h and reuse them in all the other files (even better: create templated filters for all processing), remove InternalImageReaderType?

* Move #pragma warning ( disable : 4786 ) to DefRegEval.h

* Remove all sprintf

* Clean up GetDeformedImage (probably we don't need a stencil, we can just apply the deformation field to the original image)

* Add nightly tests (Febio, tetgen, basic deformations, etc.)

* Remove hardcoded material model from FEBioWriter

* Make force constraints more generic in CreateFemModel

* Remove netgen mesh reader?

* Update examples/tests (have a few surface and image based registration tests)

* Configure FEBio make to allow use of PARDISO solver (through intel MKL or directly the PARDISO library)
