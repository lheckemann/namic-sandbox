/** \class StateMachineState
    \brief Generic implementation of the State in a State Machine model.

    This class provides a generic representation of a State.  It is  intended
    to be derived in order to implement specific states an to enforce the
    following characteristics on the behavior of the State Machine:

    \li Preclude the definition of two states with the same name.
    \li Provide high performance search for the presence of a particular state.
    \li Provide descriptive text-like definition of each state.

    These characteristics are enforced by taking advantage of natural checks
    performed by the compiler. In particular, the uniqueness of the State name
    will be enforced by making every state to be an C++ variable. The compiler
    will produce errors as a result of any attempt to repeat the name of a
    variable inside the same namespace.
