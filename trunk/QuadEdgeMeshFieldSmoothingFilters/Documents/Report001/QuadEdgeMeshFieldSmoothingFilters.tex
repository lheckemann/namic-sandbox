\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes a contribution to the Insight Toolkit intended to
smooth the values of Field data associated with the nodes of a Spherical Mesh.
The Mesh Smoothing filters contributed here do not modify the geometry or the
topology of the Mesh. They act only upon the pixel data values associated with
the nodes. Two filters are presented, one that smooths scalar field data, and a
second one that smooths vector field data.

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.
This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must
facilitate \textbf{reproducibility} of the reported results.

\section{Introduction}

A family of classes has been added recently to the Insight Toolkit for
represented oriented 2D manifolds embedded in a 3D space, objects colloquially
 known as ``Surfaces''. These classes use the QuadEdge representation in order
to ensure the consistency of the orientation all over the surface. 

Most of the filters available for this type of surface representation act upon
the geometry and topology of the Meshes. However, the Meshes are also capable
of carrying data associated with their nodes and therefore there is a need for
filters that process such associated data. The collection of values associated
with every node of a Mesh is usually called a ``Field''. In the Insight Toolkit
we have commonly referred to it as ``PixelData'' which is a bit less intuitive
but more software-oriented.  Following the first terminology, in this report we
refer to the point data as a ``Field''. This terminology is used in the
Visualization Toolkit \textbf{VTK} as well.

In this paper we contribute new classes that can be used for smoothing the
values of field data over the surface of the Mesh. The Field data can be Scalar
or Vector. Specific smoothing filters are provided for each case.

This paper is the second on a series related to implementing support for
deformable registration of Meshes according the method described in
\cite{Yeo2008}.  This reference also provide a detailed description of the
algorithm implemented here. This report will focus on the software
implementation and its usage.

\section{Overview}

The filters described in this report operate on the Field data, or Pixel Data,
of a Mesh. The Meshes are expected to be of type \doxygen{QuadEdgeMesh}.

\subsection{Algorithm}

The basic algorithm implemented in these classes is described in
\cite{Yeo2008}.  In summary the process involve visiting all the node of the
Mesh, and for each one of them, computing a new scalar value by using a
weighted average of the scalar values of the immediate neighbors.

\subsubsection{Weighted Average}

A simply scheme of two-weights is used.  The weight associated to the central
value is:

\begin{equation}
\frac{ 1 }{ 1 + \left| N_i \right|  \exp{ \left( -\frac{1}{2\lambda} \right) } }
\end{equation}

While of the neighbors values will use weights equal to

\begin{equation}
\frac{  \exp{ \left( -\frac{1}{2\lambda} \right) } }
{ 1 + \left| N_i \right| \exp{ \left( -\frac{1}{2\lambda} \right) } }
\end{equation}

Where $N_i$ is the number of neighbors of this i-th node, and $\lambda$ is a
user-provided constant that applies to the entire mesh.

This process of local weighted average is applied on all the nodes and this is
done in iteratively until reaching a use-provided number of iterations.  The
effect of the $\lambda$ parameter is such that the field data is smoothed more
when the values of $\lambda$ are large. Typical values of $\lambda$ are in the
range $[0.10,10.0]$, although they are not restricted to that range at all.

As an illustration, Table\ref{tab:LambdaValueEffect} presents the weight values
of the central node and its neighbors for different values of $\lambda$, on the
typical case of a neighborhood of six nodes.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
$\lambda$ & Neighbor Weight & Central Weight \\
\hline
\hline
0.03125 & 0.00000 & 1.00000 \\
\hline
0.06250 & 0.00033 & 0.99799 \\
\hline
0.12500 & 0.01650 & 0.90099 \\
\hline
0.25000 & 0.07469 & 0.55187 \\
\hline
0.50000 & 0.11470 & 0.31179 \\
\hline
1.00000 & 0.13074 & 0.21556 \\
\hline
2.00000 & 0.13729 & 0.17628 \\
\hline
4.00000 & 0.14019 & 0.15886 \\
\hline
8.00000 & 0.14155 & 0.15068 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\itkcaption[Effect of Lambda]{Effect on Lambda on the weights used for
computing the weighted-average of neighbors in a node with six neighbors.
\label{tab:LambdaValueEffect}}
\end{table}

As the table shows, for small values of $\lambda$, for example, less than
$0.1$, the weight of the central pixels dominates the computation, and
therefore a subtle smoothing is applied. On the other hand, for values of
$\lambda$ above $10.0$ the weights of central value is almost the same as the
weight of any of the neighbors which make the filter behave as a iterative
average filter and produce a stronger smoothing effect.


\subsubsection{Iterations}

The smoothing filter does not have a stopping criteria based on convergence. It
simply runs as many iterations as specified by the user. It is the user's
responsibility to choose how many iterations must be run.


\subsection{Smoothing Scalars}

Smoothing of Meshes with a Scalars field is implemented in the filter

\begin{center}
\code{itk::QuadEdgeMeshScalarPixelValuesSmoothingFilter}
\end{center}

This filter is suitable for a \code{QuadEdgeMesh} whose \code{PixelType} has a
single component. Typical examples will use \code{float} or \code{double} as
pixel types.

The global use of the filter requires the user to

\begin{itemize}
\item Connect an input \code{QuadEdgeMesh} of Pixel Scalar type
\item Set the values of the $\lambda$ parameter
\item Set the number of iterations.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Smoothing Vectors}

Smoothing of Meshes with a Vector field is implemented in the filter

\begin{center}
\code{itk::QuadEdgeMeshVectorPixelValuesSmoothingFilter}
\end{center}

This filter is suitable for a \code{QuadEdgeMesh} whose \code{PixelType} has a
exactly three component. The geometrical implementation of the smoothing
process is very specific to Vectors and will not be appropriate for arbitrary
arrays that are not representing a geometrical Vector in space. For example,
this method will not be appropriate for a Mesh whose pixel data are RGB color
triplets.

The particularity of this filter is that before the weighted average of the
Vectors is computed, each one of the vectors from neighbor nodes is
parallel-transported to the central node. The reason for doing this is that
vectors located at different points in the mesh are not comparable specially
when the mesh has non-zero curvature. The process of Parallel-Transform is
performed under the assumption that the surface has a Spherical geometry.
Therefore, this filter is only appropriate for Spherical surfaces.

Parallel Transport from point $p_1$ to point $p_2$ of the surface is
implemented by sliding the Vector along the greatest circle that connects
points $p_1$ and $p_2$. The filter expects the user to provide the coordinates
of the Sphere center as well as its radius. No verification if performed on
these values.

In summary, in order to use this filter, the user should 

\begin{itemize}
\item Connect an input \code{QuadEdgeMesh} of Vector Scalar type
\item Set the values of the $\lambda$ parameter
\item Set the number of iterations.
\item Set the coordinates of the Sphere center
\item Set the Sphere radius
\end{itemize}


\subsection{How to Use the Filters}

filters. The code shown here is available in the Examples directory of the code
