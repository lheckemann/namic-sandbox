\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes two methods for computing the inverse transform of a
BSpline deformable transform.

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.
This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must
facilitate \textbf{reproducibility} of the reported results.
