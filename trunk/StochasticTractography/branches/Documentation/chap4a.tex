This chapter demonstrates the analysis of fibers originating from the right internal capsule in a single subject using the stochastic tractography system.  We also demonstrate that by using a second ROI placed in the frontal lobe, we can restict our analysis to tracts which start in the right internal capsule and progress towards the frontal lobe.  Each analysis is performed with and without a white matter map to demonstrate differences in the results under these two conditions.  Without the white matter map, tracts are allowed to pass through regions of grey matter, which may not have fiber bundles.  Using the white matter map constrains the tracts to pass through only white matter known to have fiber bundles.  Finally results obtained using stochastic tractography results are compared with those obtained under streamlining tractography.

\end{figure}
The DWI data set was obtained using 6 gradient directions and one B0 image obtained in the absence of diffusion weighted gradients.  The voxels occupy 0.86mm x 0.86mm x 5mm sized cells. The right internal capsule was manually segmented using the fractional anisotropy image as a reference\footnote{Segmentation courtesy of Gudrun Rosenberger}.  The right internal capsule segmentation is considered the first region of interest (ROI).  A second region of interest(ROI) is placed anterior or towards the front of the brain, in the frontal lobe.  Figure \ref{fig:labelmap} displays the ROI's superimposed on the non-diffusion weighted b0 image of the DTI set.

In the results below, tractography was started in the right internal capsule ROI.  The stochastic tractography system was initialized to sample 100 tracts from every voxel in the internal capsule.  The actual number of samples collected may actually be less due to the use of a white matter map, which may exclude portions of the internal capsule ROI, or the rejection tracts which do not pass through a second ROI.  Without using the white matter map, the tract was terminated when it left the brain or when it reached a maximum length of 500 mm.  A whole brain mask was generated by running  the FSL BET program \cite{jenkinson05} on the B0 image.  The brain measures about 185 mm in diameter.  Thus a 500 mm maximum tract length should be long to enough to generate all anatomically plausible tracts.  When using a white matter map, tracts can only pass through regions of white matter and are terminated when they leave white matter.  As a result, seed points in the grey matter cannot be used to initiate tractography.  The white matter map was generated by running the FSL FAST program on the B0 image \cite{zhang01}.

\section{Single ROI}
In this analysis all possible tracts which originated from the right internal capsule ROI were sampled and included in the output.

  \label{fig:singlecmaps}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:singlecmaps} presents connectivity maps generated using the stochastic tractography system.  The color of each voxel indicates the number of tracts which pass through that voxel.  Since seeding was initiated in the internal capsule, it appears highly connected to itself in the connectivity map.  Notice the strong connectivity of some voxels in the frontal lobe using stochastic tractography with and without the white matter map.  Without the white matter map \ref{fig:singlecmaps:a} connections are dispersed throughout the brain.  With the white matter map, the resultant spatial distribution of the fibers is more concentrated because false tracts are not generated in grey matter.  Additionally, the number of sampled tracts when using the white matter map is reduced because the right internal capsule ROI may include some grey matter which cannot produce any tract samples.

	}
	\caption{Histogram showing distribution of tract-averaged fractional anisotropy for tracts which originate in the right internal capsule.}
\end{figure}

We can also study statistics on individual sampled tracts.  The distribution of tract-averaged fractional anisotropy is graphed in figure \ref{fig:singleFAhistograms}.  Notice that using the white matter map predictably increases the mean of the distribution (Figure \ref{fig:singleFAhistograms:a}), since the sampled tracts no longer pass through gray matter which has low anisotropy.  Additionally, the number of sampled tracts also decreases when using the white matter map because some of the voxels in the right internal capsule ROI were identified as grey matter.

	}
	\caption{Histogram showing distribution of fiber lengths for sampled frontal lobe tracts.}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:singelengthhistograms} plots the distribution of lengths on the sampled tracts.  Without the white matter map many fibers reach the arbitrary maximum tract limit of 500 (Figure \ref{fig:singlelengthhistograms:a}, providing little information about the actual distribution of tract lenghts.  With the white matter posterior probability map, few sampled tracts reach 500mm and the distribution of tract lengths may be more representative of the true distribution.


\section{Two ROIs}

In addition to sampling all possible fibers from a seed region, the stochastic tractography system can optionally reject all sampled tracts which do not pass through a second ROI.  This method isolates fiber bundles which connect two ROIs.  
\begin{figure} \label{fig:twocmaps}
  \subfigure[Without white matter map]{
    \label{fig:twocmaps:a}
	  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{slicer-0021}

  \subfigure[With white matter map]{

	}
	\caption{Connectivity map overlaid on a fractional anisotropy image showing the probability that a voxel is connected to the internal capsule by a fiber which passes through a second ROI in the frontal lobe.}
\end{figure}

The connectivity maps in Figure \ref{fig:twocmaps} show the probability that a voxel is connected to the right internal capsule by a fiber originating in the right internal capsule which passes through the second ROI located in the frontal lobe.  Unsurprisingly, regions in the frontal lobe are much more likely to be connected via these fibers than anywhere else in the brain.

\begin{figure} \label{fig:twoFAhistograms}
  \subfigure[Without white matter map]{
    \label{fig:twoFAhistograms:a}
	  \includegraphics[trim = 20mm 70mm 20mm 70mm, clip, width=0.5\linewidth]

  }
  \subfigure[With white matter map]{
    \label{fig:twoFAhistograms:b}
	  \includegraphics[trim = 20mm 70mm 20mm 70mm, clip, width=0.5\linewidth]
	    {hist_FA_mask_two}
	}
	\caption{A histogram of tract-averaged fractional anisotropy for fibers which originate in the right internal capsule and pass through an ROI in the frontal lobe.}
\end{figure}

Although 100 tract samples were attempted by the algorithm, only a fraction pass through the second ROI.  Thus the histograms in figures \ref{fig:twoFAhistograms} and \ref{fig:twolengthhistograms} contain fewer total tracts than those in figures \ref{fig:singleFAhistograms} and \ref{fig:singelengthhistograms}.  Notice that using the white matter map again increases the mean of the tract-averaged fractional anisotropy distribution (Figure \ref{fig:twoFAhistograms:b}) by preventing tracts from passing through low anisotropy grey matter.

\begin{figure} \label{fig:twolengthhistograms}
  \subfigure[Without white matter map]{
    \label{fig:twolengthhistograms:a}
	  \includegraphics[trim = 20mm 70mm 20mm 70mm, clip, width=0.5\linewidth]

	\subfigure[With white matter map]{

	    {hist_length_mask_two}
  }
	\caption{A histogram of lengths for sampled fibers which start in the right internal capsule and pass through the ROI in the frontal lobe. }
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:twolengthhistograms} demonstrates that using the white matter map provides more meaningful distributions of length than tracking without using one.

\section{Comparison with streamlining tractography}
In this section, we compare the results of streamlining tractography and stochastic tractography from the same data using the same ROIs.  The streamlining tractography results are generated using the streamline tractography method in 3D Slicer.  The streamline method used every voxel inside the segmented internal capsule as a seed region.  The generated streamline tracts were only accepted if they passed through the second ROI in the frontal lobe.  Tracking was terminated in the streamline method when the current voxel's anisotropy fell below a minimum threshold.  The stochastic tractography results were those reported in the previous section and depicted in figures \ref{fig:twoFAhistograms} and \ref{fig:twolengthhistograms}.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

	\caption{A volumetrically rendered connectivity map generated using stochastic tractography overlayed on tracts generated using streamlining tractography.  The results are generated using identical input data and ROIs.}
	\label{fig:streamlinestochastic}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:streamlinerendering} and \ref{fig:streamlinestochastic} visually compare the results of streamlining and stochastic tractography results using the same input data and ROIs.  Figure \ref{fig:streamlinestochastic} overlays a volume rendering of the connectivity map generated using stochastic tractography on the tracts generated using the streamlining method.  In this image the grey/black cloud is a 3D rendering of the connectivity map.  Although it is difficult to gauge the degree of connectivity in the volume rendering, it is clear that there exist regions which, according to stochastic tractography, have nonzero probability of connectivity but do not have streamline tracts passing through them.  Additionally, notice that in the region of the most inferior, or downward, streamline tracts, the stochastic tractography reports relatively weak connectivity.  The streamline method generates tracts in this improbable region because the anisotropy in this area is above the minimum threshold.  However since the stochastic tractography method takes into account the uncertainty in fiber direction, it determines that these tracts are much less likely to occur than a tract which is more superior, or upwards.

  \label{fig:streamlinecomphistFA}
}
Figure \ref{fig:streamlinecomphistFA} compares tract-average FA distributions of the same tracts of interest under stochastic and streamlining tractography.  The histograms are both approximately normal with some left skew under streamlining tractography.  The distribution under stochastic tractography is very smooth because the sample size is much larger than under streamlining tractography.   In stochastic tractography many possible tracts can be sampled from a single seed voxel while only one tract per seed voxel can be generated under streamlining tractography resulting in a maximum of 1,372 tracts.  Additionally, the mean of the distribution under stochastic tractography is higher than under streamlining tractography.  Since FA is related to uncertainty, stochastic tractography will generate more tracts which pass though regions of high FA.  As more tracts are sample they will tend to concentrate in regions of high FA.  Thus the mean of the tract-average FA distribution is increased in stochastic tractography compared to streamlining tractography.  This affect may not be as prominant when tracking in predominantly isotropic regions as this concentrating effect is not present.

    \label{fig:streamlinecomphistLength}
}

Figure \ref{fig:streamlinecomphistLength} compares the distribution of tract lengths in the stochastic tractography and streamlining cases.  While the distributions look similar, increased sampling in stochastic tractography eliminates the shorter tracts in favor of tracts around 50 mm in length.  Again, this is due to stochastic tractography's ability to take into account tract probability.  Also, the similarity in the distribution further emphasizes the importance of using the white matter mask as the distibutions are not very similar when stochastic tractography is run without the white matter mask.

%\end{table}

%Finally, table \ref{tab:streamlinecomp} compares the mean of the distribution of tract-averaged fractional anisotropy values.  The stochastic tractography results may have a higher mean because tracts which pass through more anisotropic regions occur with greater frequency, weighing the mean tract-averaged fractional anisotropy value towards a higher value.
