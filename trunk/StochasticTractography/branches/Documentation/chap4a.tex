	\caption{A histogram of estimated fiber lengths.  The image on the left does not use a posterior white matter probability map while the one on the right does.  Notice that without the white matter posterior many fibers reach the arbitrary maximum tract limit of 500, providing little information about the actual distribution of tract lenghts.  With the white matter posterior probability map, the distribution of tract lengths is more plausible and few make it to the arbitrary 500 max length limit.}

The image on the left is without the use of a white matter posterior probability map.  The image on the right is with a white matter posterior probability map.  Notice that the reduced spatial variance of the fibers in the when using the white matter posterior.  Additionally, since we are excluding many tracts which don't pass through both ROI's, we have fewer samples.  Using the white matter posterior probability map the similar affect of reducing the number of acceptable sampels.}

	\caption{On left: Tracts generated using a streamlining method.  On Right: The connectivity map visualized using volume texture rendering overlaid on the streamline generated tracts.  While the two results are similar there are some key differences.Notice that there are regions where there is nonzero probability of connectivity which no tracts from the stream line method pass though.  Also notice that there are regions which have manny streamlines but which the stochastic tractography algorithm predicts is weakly connected. }
