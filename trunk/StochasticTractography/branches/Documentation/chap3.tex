\chapter{Stochastic White Matter Tractography}
%talk through key portions of the math
%present a block diagram of the algorithm

%talk about how it differs from other algorithms
%talk about using incorporating the posterior probability of white matter
%talk about why we choose to segment the gray/white matter using b0 image instead of using diffusion information
