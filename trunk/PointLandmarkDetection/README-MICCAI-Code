The code for the MICCAI open source workshop is in the directories:

MICCAI-correlationmethod 
(this is the method based on estimating th correlation matrix at each pixel location and using the determinant to calculate a cornerness measure.)

MICCAI-curvaturemethod
(this is the method based on estimating the Gaussian (isointensity) curvature at each pixel location.

Usage:

In the above mentioned directories do:
> mkdir build
> cd build

> ccmake ../code

> make
