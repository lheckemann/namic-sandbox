\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes an addition to the Image IO Library of the Insight Toolkit (ITK).
ITK has been able to read in Anaylze image files but not the object maps that correspond
to the images.  Without the object maps, regions of interest were not being shown.
These regions of interest are helpful in desginating locations, giving a name to those
locations, as well as colors and other informatoin, which is useful if you are trying to tell
someone where to look in an image.  This report describes the reason why this code should be
added into ITK and how to use the code.

\section{Description}

\section{Object Maps}

\section{Examples}

This section provides some examples on how to use the programs.
\begin{itemize}
\item Example 1 

This example is for reading in an Analyze object map and
then use vtk to display the object map.  The user will need ITK,
Insight Applications (for itkImageToVTKImageFilter), and VTK.

Command:

\textbf{AnalyzeObjectExample1.exe test.obj 0}  

\item Example 2

This example is for reading in any file, then creating a new object map,
then add entries to the object map and then finally write the object map out to a file.

Command:

\textbf{AnalyzeObjectExample2.exe 2dtest.nii creatingObject.obj}
\end{itemize}
