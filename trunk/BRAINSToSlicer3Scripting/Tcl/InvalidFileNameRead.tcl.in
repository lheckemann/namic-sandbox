## This simple script is causing Slicer to have a Bus Error
## I would expect that attempting to read a file that does not exists should not cause
## Slicer to have a Bus Error

set fileName @COMMON_DATA_DIR@/XYZ_THIS_FILE_DOES_NOT_EXISTS.nii.gz
set inputImage [ b3_load_image ${fileName} ]
#${inputImage} Delete
