\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes a simple helper class intended for making easy to
initialize the grid parameters of a \doxygen{BSplineDeformableTranform}.

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.
This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must
facilitate \textbf{reproducibility} of the reported results.

\section{Introduction}

When using a BSplineDeformableTranform for the purpose of performing deformable
registration or for the purpose of resampling an image, it is customary to
initialize the parameters of the BSpline grid based on the parameters of the
fixed image or based on the parameters of image that is the output space of the
resampling process. This initialization, however, requires the software
developer to remember to set several critical details. Forgetting any of these
details can easily lead to a failed registration or a failed resampling. The
process of finding the source of the problem can be a very frustrating
experience.

The class described in this report is intended to simplify the initialization
of a BSplineDeformableTranform and to ensure that no small detail is missed in
the process.
