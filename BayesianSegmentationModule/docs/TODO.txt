Things left To Do:

1) Wrap in VTK (check for other wrappings):  BayesianInitialization together with BayesianClassification (remember to cvs update slicer2/Lib/ITK)

2) Commit to ITK CVS after the freeze

3) Write SetMask() for InitializationFilter à Mask ImageToListGenerator

4) Write normalization for GetPosteriorImage

5) Change ScalarKmeans to VectorKmeans

6) Initialization Test:  Adding Membership Functions

7) Classification Test:  Adding Priors

8) Send email to Steve Pieper to point Slicer ITK download to a more recent ITK version
