PROJECT (febio)

# There is nothing to build, just copy a precompiled release.
# The febio solver is open source and can quite simply built using CMake.
# However, to build a release that runs efficiently the Pardiso solver
# has to be obtained and build, too. So, it is easier to just download the
# release from http://mrl.sci.utah.edu/software/febio
